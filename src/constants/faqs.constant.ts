    q: 'Why trade with leverage?',
    a: 'Leverage trading opens up new prospects for traders, allowing them to handle large amounts of funds with relatively small investments. This tool helps increase potential profits, improve asset liquidity and expand the trading portfolio. However, it is important to remember that while leverage is attractive, it also increases the level of risk. Traders should be prepared for potential losses and carefully manage their investments to avoid financial difficulties. Regardless of experience, using leverage requires caution and a strategic approach for effective trading.'
